        <description>
            <p>Head buried in a Monster Encyclopedia, a small kobold quickly identifies the snarling beast attacking the nearby shelter as a Chimera, offering his allies valuable insight into its strengths, weaknesses before charging into battle with sword drawn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Cornered and separated from her allies in a dark sewer a dwarf steels herself, calling upon the lore of a shadow demon to step into the darkness, emerging behind the patrol. Her grinning mouth distends delivering a fatal bite to an ooze, devouring it whole.</p>
            <p class="indent">Her eyes light up with understanding as she unravels new secret lore.</p>
            <p class="indent">An orc dives between the ankheg and his ally, mandibles clattering off his shield. He focuses for a moment on the multitude of monstrous essences within his mind and draws one of them out, his eyes shimmering with an unearthly glow as the monster rapidly turns to stone.</p>
            <p class="indent">Monstrous as they may seem blue mages come in as many forms as the fascinating creatures they research.</p>
            <p class="indent">By mastering the exotic power of blue magic they can adopt the magical abilities of monsters, turning their foes greatest strengths against them.</p>
            <h4>Taming the Beast</h4>
            <p>Blue mages approach their studies in a variety of ways, but each of them rely on the same principle - learning to alter their inner beast.</p>
            <p>Every living being has a primal force within them that drives their base instincts - be it fight or flight, the need to sate hunger, or the gut feeling that informs your decisions - this is the beast.</p>
            <p>By accessing the beasts within other creatures it is possible to teach your beast their tricks!</p>
            <p>How they manipulate magic, how they alter their bodies, and shape their minds to perform the extraordinary feats that monsters are famed for.</p>
            <p>Through the study of monsterology these bestial secrets are uncovered and recorded as Lore, which can be memorized, made part of your own beast, and expressed through your physical form.</p>
            <p>Lore allows the blue mage to mimic just about anything a monster can do, no matter its size - the hard part is surviving long enough to learn it!</p>
            <h4>Weird Science</h4>
            <p>Unfortunately, blue magic is a new endeavor and as such often fraught with misunderstandings and skepticism from the arcane establishment.</p>
            <p>It is also a double edged sword, trying to achieve what monsters can do without being labeled as a monster yourself.</p>
            <p>These social roadblocks lead most blue mages to researching in the field, engaging with monsters up close and personal - not a task for the faint of heart but certainly a necessity.</p>
            <p>Many will join adventuring parties simply because it gives them better odds of survival while taking notes.</p>
            <p>The research subjects don't last very long, but better them than you!</p>
            <p>It's only by adventuring and encountering monsters in person that the schools of monsterology can be built upon, boundaries pushed, and the study of blue magic legitimized in the eyes of academic naysayers.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A BLUE MAGE</h4>
            <p>Creating a blue mage character demands an unorthodox history.</p>
            <p>How did your character discover this strange new kind of magic? How did you discover you had a talent for it?</p>
            <p>Do you have a natural aptitude, or did you study hard and keep trying things until you found something that worked?</p>
            <p>Did you have a run in with a monster, or a strange event that revealed the inner beast to you? What made you decide to do more than just study?</p>
            <p>Did making contact with your inner beast change you? Does it hunger for power or perhaps encourage you to better yourself?</p>
            <p>Do you seek a journey of self discovery, or do you want to contribute to the budding academic presence of monsterology? Perhaps you're looking for notoriety, vengeance against a monster that wronged you, or maybe you seek to become a monster yourself.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>

        <description>
            <p>Also at 1st level, your study of the inner beast has reached a breakthrough revealing the art of Lore - studies and insights into other creatures that allow you to manifest the features and qualities of monsters.</p>
            <h4>Memorizing and Using Lore</h4>
            <p>You memorize a list of blue mage lore from those you have available in your research journal. While memorized a lore is treated as a class feature for you, and you can make use of it as described.</p>
            <p>To memorize lore, choose any combination of blue mage lore up to the memorization limit for your level as shown on the blue mage table. Using lore doesn't remove it from your list.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of memorized lore when you finish a long rest. Memorizing a new list of blue mage lore requires time spent studying your research journal and meditating to commune with your inner beast: at least 5 minutes per lore.</p>
            <h4>Learning Lore</h4>
            <p>You can work for 1 hour as part of a long rest, focusing on an essence you possess to extract knowledge from it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Select a bestial lore that you meet the prerequisites for from an appropriate school. Your choice is added to the species' entry in your journal and the essence is lost.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can always learn lore from the Ancestral school, however some creature types grant you access to more obscure schools of lore. Check the Schools of Monsterology table below to see if the creature's type grants you access to a specialized school.</p>
            <p>You can only know one lore for each species at a time unless otherwise specified, however you can choose to replace a lore if you acquire essence from a member of its species again. Doing so removes the old lore from your memorized list if it is currently memorized.</p>

            <p>*Note that you cannot learn lore from humanoids</p>     
            <h4>Lore Ability</h4>
            <p>Intelligence is the ability score used for your blue mage lore, so you use your Intelligence whenever a lore refers to your lore ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a blue mage lore and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
            <p><strong>Lore save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><br />
            <p><strong>Lore attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
